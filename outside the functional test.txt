Not only the functional tests we should make, we also need to make stress test and proformance tests.


Why we should make stress test
We should make sure the reliability and stability of all of your web resources, for example to manage a high number of visitors or huge traffic

The goal of stress test
The goal is to test the recoverability of the system, after the failure the system should recovers smoothly,and find the roott cause of the system crash.
1, Evaluating the stability and reliability of resources or application under heavy traffic conditions. 
2, Optimizing the system to avoid breakdown.
3, Planning the scalability and resource requirement correctly.

The types of stress test 
1, Application Stress Test
	* The goal is to find data and network bottlenecks for an application to optimize the performance.
2, System Stress Test
	* the tests make between different applications running on the same server to identify the blocking situations


API performance testing

1, We can identify slow API, memory leaks
2, We can use mocking the data as expected in real-time
3, It is very important to identify the right APIs for testing
	* Being called Frequency
	* With heavy actions
	* If it is in production, we can use the usage statistics to find out the functionality/API is facing high traffic
4, We can use Jmeter to create Virtual Users to make the calls for the selected APIs
5, The performance tests we can perform
	* Indexing, when the requirements grow or change, the indexes were not optimized
	* Pagination, querying takes less time and memory
	* Caching, query data which is static or which do not change a lot from database
	* Mock data; mock the data from application flow which is useful to have the right set of data
